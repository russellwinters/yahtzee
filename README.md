# yahtzee

### Purpose: ?

I had started this repo when I was furst entering the industry, hoping to sharpen my vanilla JS skills. At this point I'm thinking that it would actually be fun to use a yahtzee app as a testing ground when trying new frameworks, libraries and languages because it's a familiar problem that requires some level of forethought.

### Why Yahtzee?

In deciding what to do, I'm finding what I look for is:

- Something that I am familiar with
- Something that requires basic use of a language or framework, but the ability to put pieces together in something larger than a singular file or couple of functions.
- Something I can actually play around with after it's done

### End Product:

Hoping to use this repo as a testing ground. Dropped the initial app into the `/chrome-extension` directory, and am thinking of adding different apps in due time.
