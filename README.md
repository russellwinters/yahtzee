# yahtzee

### Purpose:

I had started this repo when I was furst entering the industry, hoping to sharpen my vanilla JS skills. At this point I'm thinking that it would actually be fun to use a yahtzee app as a testing ground when trying new frameworks, libraries and languages because it's a familiar problem that requires some level of forethought.

### Why Yahtzee?

In deciding what to do, I'm finding what I look for is:

- Something that I am familiar with
- Something that requires basic use of a language or framework, but the ability to put pieces together in something larger than a singular file or couple of functions.
- Something I can actually play around with after it's done

### End Product:

Hoping to use this repo as a testing ground. Current implementations:

- `/chrome-extension` - Initial vanilla JS implementation
- `/actix` - Rust implementation using Actix framework
- `/ytz` - Elixir implementation with custom HTTP server
